This include the basic testing and training of flowers using scikit dataset (iris)

# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification with Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using the classic **Iris dataset** from Scikit-learn. The goal is to classify iris flowers into their species based on their features.

# Project Overview

* Loads the Iris dataset and converts it into a Pandas DataFrame
* Explores the dataset briefly with `.head()` and `.describe()`
* Splits the data into **training** (70%) and **testing** (30%) sets
* Trains a **Logistic Regression** model on the training data
* Makes predictions on the test data
* Evaluates the model with:

  * Accuracy score
  * Confusion matrix
  * Classification report** showing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class

 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib (for any visualizations if added later)
* scikit-learn

 How to Run

1. Install the required libraries (if you don't have them)
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script.

 Results

* Accuracy of the model is printed in the console
* Confusion matrix and classification report provide detailed insights into model performance
